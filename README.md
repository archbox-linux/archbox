#ArchBox

ArchBox means Arch Linux + Openbox

This project contains [archiso](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/archiso) profile to build ready-to-use iso with [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) and preconfigured [Openbox](http://openbox.org) window manager.

For now it is just a live media. In plans - with ability to install.
